# SimpleGuessingGame
An android app that asks you to guess a random integer. The app keeps track of your total number of guessses/correct guesses and vibrates when you guess correctly. The app can also store and restore the instance state to preserve the number of correct and total guesses. The app also allows you to send your "score" to a phone number.
